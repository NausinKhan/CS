	<div class="para1">
<p>Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.

Science may be as old as the human species, and some of the earliest archeological evidence for scientific reasoning is tens of thousands of years old. The earliest written records in the history of science come from Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 BCE. Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages, but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age.
</p>
<p>
The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived "natural philosophy", which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions. The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape; along with the changing of "natural philosophy" to "natural science".
</p>
<p>
Modern science is typically divided into three major branches: natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study the physical world; the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies; and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which study formal systems, governed by axioms and rules. There is disagreement whether the formal sciences are science disciplines, because they do not rely on empirical evidence. Applied sciences are disciplines that use scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as in engineering and medicine
</p>
<p>
New knowledge in science is advanced by research from scientists who are motivated by curiosity about the world and a desire to solve problems. Contemporary scientific research is highly collaborative and is usually done by teams in academic and research institutions, government agencies, and companies. The practical impact of their work has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the ethical and moral development of commercial products, armaments, health care, public infrastructure, and environmental protection.

<h3><b>Branches</b></h3>
<hr>
<p1>Modern science is commonly divided into three major branches: natural science, social science, and formal science. Each of these branches comprises various specialized yet overlapping scientific disciplines that often possess their own nomenclature and expertise. Both natural and social sciences are empirical sciences, as their knowledge is based on empirical observations and is capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions.</p1>
<ul>
<li><b>Natural science</b>
<p>Natural science is the study of the physical world. It can be divided into two main branches: life science and physical science. These two branches may be further divided into more specialized disciplines. For example, physical science can be subdivided into physics, chemistry, astronomy, and earth science. Modern natural science is the successor to the natural philosophy that began in Ancient Greece. Galileo, Descartes, Bacon, and Newton debated the benefits of using approaches which were more mathematical and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, conjectures, and presuppositions, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science.Systematic data collection, including discovery science, succeeded natural history, which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on. Today, "natural history" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.</p>

<li><b>Social science</b>
<p>Social science is the study of human behavior and functioning of societies. It has many disciplines that include, but are not limited to anthropology, economics, history, human geography, political science, psychology, and sociology. In the social sciences, there are many competing theoretical perspectives, many of which are extended through competing research programs such as the functionalists, conflict theorists, and interactionists in sociology. Due to the limitations of conducting controlled experiments involving large groups of individuals or complex situations, social scientists may adopt other research methods such as the historical method, case studies, and cross-cultural studies. Moreover, if quantitative information is available, social scientists may rely on statistical approaches to better understand social relationships and processes.</p>

<li><b>Formal science</b>
<p>Formal science is an area of study that generates knowledge using formal systems. A formal system is an abstract structure used for inferring theorems from axioms according to a set of rules. It includes mathematics, systems theory, and theoretical computer science. The formal sciences share similarities with the other two branches by relying on objective, careful, and systematic study of an area of knowledge. They are, however, different from the empirical sciences as they rely exclusively on deductive reasoning, without the need for empirical evidence, to verify their abstract concepts. The formal sciences are therefore a priori disciplines and because of this, there is disagreement on whether they constitute a science. Nevertheless, the formal sciences play an important role in the empirical sciences. Calculus, for example, was initially invented to understand motion in physics. Natural and social sciences that rely heavily on mathematical applications include mathematical physics, chemistry, biology, finance, and economics.</p>

<li><b>Applied science</b>
<p>Applied science or technology is the use of the scientific method and knowledge to attain practical goals and includes a broad range of disciplines such as engineering and medicine. Engineering is the use of scientific principles to invent, design and build machines, structures and technologies. Medicine is the practice of caring for patients by maintaining and restoring health through the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of injury or disease. The applied sciences are often contrasted with the basic sciences, which are focused on advancing scientific theories and laws that explain and predict events in the natural world.
Computational science applies computing power to simulate real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve. The use of machine learning and artificial intelligence is becoming a central feature of computational contributions to science for example in agent-based computational economics, random forests, topic modeling and various forms of prediction. However, machines alone rarely advance knowledge as they require human guidance and capacity to reason; and they can introduce bias against certain social groups or sometimes underperform against humans.</p>

<h3><b>Science Stream After 10th: Subjects</b></h3><hr>
<hr>
<p>Before we go on to understand what are the subjects in the science stream after the 10th, a major point to note is that it offers 2 substreams. <b>Non-medical</b> and<b> Medical </b>are the 2 substreams available. If you want to pursue a career in science but not in Medicine, you can opt for a Non-medical stream. On the other hand, if you are certain of kick-starting a career in medicine, you should choose the Medical stream.

You will be presented with <b>Physics, Chemistry, and Biology (PCB)</b> if you opt for the medical stream. However, Mathematics remains to be optional. For those choosing non-medical; <b>Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics (PCM)</b> are the mandatory subjects. The non-medical students can choose one more mandatory subject as per their choice. English/Hindi is a compulsory subject for both fields.</p>
Now let us understand in detail what these subjects entail-
<ul>
<li><b>Physics</b>
Physics is defined as the study of the structure of matter and how the tiny particles of the universe interact. The curriculum of Physics for class 11th and 12th focus on the topics like motion in a straight line, units of measurements, thermodynamics, kinetic energy, waves and oscillation, laws of motion, motion in a plane, gravitation, mechanical properties of fluids, thermal properties of matter and solids, laws of motion.
<li><b>Chemistry</b>
Class 11th and 12th Chemistry will no longer only revolve around chemical reactions. During these years, you will be taken through various in-depth theories based on molecules, the structure of atoms, and chemical equations. Alongside these topics, many new topics like equilibrium, hydrogen, classification of elements, hydrocarbons, periodicity properties, redox reaction, e-block and p-block elements, thermodynamics, organic chemistry, and states of matter
<li><b>Mathematics</b>
Considered one of the most difficult subjects in classes 11th and 12th, mathematics needs your time and dedication through the journey. Initially, the concepts of this subject will require more focus but, with time you can develop a better hold over the subject. Here are some of the important chapters trigonometric functions, relations and functions, straight lines, linear inequalities, permutations and combinations, probability, statistics, mathematical reasoning, quadratic equations, binomial theorem, conic sections, mathematical induction, limits, and derivatives, and three-dimensional geometry.
<li><b>Biology</b>
Biology's curriculum of these classes will open doors to a new world of the living! The core of class 11th will be Botany, whereas, class 12th will focus on Zoology. The chapters for the 11th and 12th can be numbered, but the study of Biology will be vast.
