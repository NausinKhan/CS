on a large scale. Commerce not only includes trade, which is the actual transaction, exchange or transfer of goods and services, but also 
the auxiliary services and means which facilitate such trade. These auxiliary services include transportation, communication, warehousing, 
insurance, banking, advertising, packaging, etc. In other words, commerce encompasses a wide array of political, logistical, legal, regulatory, 
social, and economic aspects of trade on a large scale. From a marketing perspective, commerce creates time and place utility by making
