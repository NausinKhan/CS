In today's world, biology courses are no longer limited to M.B.B.S. Biology students have numerous opportunities to learn about the subject and pursue a well-known career which provides them with multiple opportunities to research, examine, and explore the various branches of biology. For the advancement in research, those who studied medical science in the 11th and 12th grades do not need to limit themselves to M.B.B.S. or subjects that are strictly limited to science; modern technology has opened the doors to interdisciplinary fields. 
<br>
<h3><b>Major Specialisation In Biology</b></h3>
<hr>
Biology is a branch of science that studies life and living organisms and is not limited to general medicine. As a result, after the 12th, one can explore a wide range of subfields within this domain. We have listed some of the significant interdisciplinary specialisations for those looking for biology courses after 12th except M.B.B.S. to aid you in your research.
<b>
Consider enrolling in a biology programme to learn more about plants, animals, and ecosystems. Students may study organisms at the macro or micro-level, depending on their college or university. Knowing what you will learn in a biology programme can help you decide if biology is the right major for you. 
We define this major in this article and the courses biology students frequently take, and the different types of biology majors.

<h3><b>List Of Courses In Biology After 12th Except MBBS</b></h3><hr>
<p>
Biology courses after 12th grade, except M.B.B.S. - Passing, are the days when students studying P.C.B. in 12th grade could only consider medicine as a career option. Biology courses after class 12 are no longer limited to M.B.B.S. Suppose you studied biology in grades 11 and 12. In that case, you have many options for exploring the subject and pursuing a career in the medical and paramedical fields, which are well-known and well-paid.
</p>
<h4><b>1)Bachelor of Dental Surgery (B.D.S.)</b></h4>
<p>
Except for M.B.B.S., dentistry is one of the most popular career options in biology. In this undergraduate degree programme, you will learn about dentures, dental problems, and surgery, as well as human anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry, dental materials, prosthodontics, microbiology, embryology and histology, general and dental pharmacology and pathology, periodontics, pedodontics, orthodontics, and dentistry.
</p>
<h4><b>2)Genetic Engineering (B Tech)</b></h4>
<p>
Genetic Engineering is a biotechnology branch that deals with modifying, introducing, and altering genetic materials. A bachelor's degree in technology (genetic engineering) is available from various institutions, and this field includes not only biology but also advanced technology that aids research. Several major international companies fund genetic engineering research in both plants and animals. Plants with insect resistance, plants that can tolerate herbicides, and crops with modified oil content are just a few examples of genetically engineered organisms.
</p>
<h4><b>3)Bachelor of Veterinary Science (B.VSc)</b></h4>
<p>
Bachelor of Veterinary Sciences is also one of the most popular courses among students looking for biology courses after 12th grade that are not as expensive as M.B.B.S. If you enjoy working with animals and want to pursue a career in medicine, this could be an excellent choice. Veterinary Sciences is concerned with the medical aspects of animal anatomy, and you will be taught how to diagnose, treat, and research animal medical conditions and diseases.
</p>
<h4><b>4)Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS)</b></h4>
<p>
BAMS is a professional ayurvedic medicine course. This course focuses on concepts of Ayurveda and Ayurvedic medicine. It will provide you with an in-depth understanding of anatomy, physiology, toxicology, pharmacology, and the history of the Ayurvedic system. Apart from M.B.B.S., becoming an Ayurveda specialist is becoming one of the most popular career options in Biology.
</p>
<h4><b>5)Bachelor of Science in Nursing</b></h4>
<p>
Suppose you want to work in the health sector and serve the community. In that case, nursing is one of the most popular career options in Biology, aside from M.B.B.S. After class 12, you can pursue one of three nursing courses: Auxiliary Nursery & Midwife Diploma (A.N.M.), General Nursing & Midwife (G.N.M.), or B.Sc. Nursing. Topics covered in the nursing programme include health care management, anatomy, primary health nursing, community health, and child health.
</p>
<h4><b>6)Environmental Science (B.Sc.)</b></h4>
<p>
Environmental science is concerned with studying the physical, chemical, and biological conditions of the environment and developing solutions to environmental problems. Except for M.B.B.S., it is one of the newer career options in biology. Environmental issues such as waste management, water and air pollution, global warming, ozone depletion, climate change, and so on can be probed and investigated. You can work as a Horticulturist, Environmental Engineer, or for various government departments and agencies such as Forestry, Pollution Control Board, Agriculture, and so on after studying Environmental Science.
</p>
<h4><b>7)Nutrition and Dietetics (B.Sc.)</b></h4>
<p>
Nutritionists and dietitians examine and evaluate individuals' dietary habits and then provide advice on health and food choices. Dietetics is the practice of designing, monitoring, and supervising a client's or patient's diet. Except for M.B.B.S., this is one of the most popular career options in biology.
</p>
<h4><b>8)B.sc Agriculture</b></h4>
<p>
Modern agriculture and farming practices have created a constant demand for researchers, developers, and administrators to ensure that crops are grown with minimal input costs. B.Sc. in Agriculture is undervalued, but it is one of the best courses in Biology after 12th grade, aside from M.B.B.S., which pays well. The course will introduce a wide range of agricultural practices and new and advanced technologies in the field, emphasising water resource management, soil texture, poultry management, and other topics. As an Agriculturist scientist, Landscaping Manager, Crop Trial Officer, and so on, you can work in Agribusiness, Food processing units, Seed Technology farms, and Agricultural banks.
