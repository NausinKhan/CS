            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In current times, engineering has offered a beacon of hope to aspiring students as a stable career choice. It’s a great way to future-proof your career and branch out from a technical standpoint.
                Fields like civil and electronics engineering have always been safe picks. Still, of late, new and contemporary fields like nanotechnology and genetic engineering are becoming prominent with every passing academic year. In that regard, there are two main career paths you can choose if you pick engineering.
                Every course you study in an engineering degree will have some connection to technical applications. There’s no substitute for the time spent in the many workshops and engineering labs as part of the course. It’s what gives you a leg up over the countless people opting for a B.Sc. degree in the same specialization.
