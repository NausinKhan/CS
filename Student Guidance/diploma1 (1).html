A diploma is a document awarded by an educational institution (such as a college or university) testifying the recipient has graduated 
by successfully completing their courses of studies.Historically, it has also referred to a charter or official document of diplomacy.
The diploma (as a document certifying a qualification) may also be called a testamur, Latin for "we testify" or "certify" (testari), so called
 from the word with which the certificate begins; this is commonly used in Australia to refer to the document certifying the award of a
 degree. Alternatively, this document can simply be referred to as a degree certificate or graduation certificate, or as a parchment.
 The certificate that a Nobel laureate receives is also called a diploma.
The term diploma is also used in some historical contexts, to refer to documents signed by a King affirming a grant or tenure of specified
 land and its conditions (see Anglo-Saxon Charters and Diplomatics).
</p>
<p>
a diploma is a specific academic award usually earned in professional/vocational courses, e.g., Diploma in Engineering, Diploma in Nursing,
 Diploma in Pharmacy etc. Engineering diplomas are concentrated for the area of study, e.g., diploma in Electronics Engineering,
 Electrical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering etc.
There are two types of diplomas/certificates that are issued in formal and non-formal education sectors: formal diplomas are issued by
 government-approved/recognized institutions, colleges and universities and non-formal diplomas are issued by NGOs, companies and 
societies etc. outside the formal education sector.
